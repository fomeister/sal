This page explains how SAL integrates with a well-known middleware suite for sensor networks: Data Turbine.

= Data Turbine =
Data Turbine is an robust open source streaming middleware for sensor-based environmental observation systems. It acts as a ring buffer where data sources (typically sensors) insert readings periodically. The ring buffer is essentially a very large cache where data can be extracted by sinks.
Data Turbine is available at [http://www.dataturbine.org here].

= SAL-T project =
The SAL Transport project (SAL-T) acts as a SAL client, retrieves streams of data from sensors as reported by SAL, and inserts them into a Data Turbine ring buffer.

= Future work =
One advantage of Data Turbine is that it runs on embedded platforms (like Gumstix), and a hierarchical structure of Data Turbine ring buffers can be easily created.

The functionalities of a SAL agent running on a embedded sensor gateway can be extended by running an instance of a (small) ring buffer locally, which acts as a data cache in case network connectivity is temporarily unavailable. The local ring buffer can then be connected to a larger one running on a more powerful platform. This approach can improve fault tolerance, but may increase latency, ie it may take longer for a single data element extracted from a sensor to reach users.
